	    	<h2>General Information</h2>
	    		<p> The Gerenuk is also know as the <i>giraffe gazelle</i>, and is a
	    		long-necked antelope that in mainly found in the Horn of Africa and 
	    		drier parts of East Africa. They live in woodland forests or open plains.
	    		The Gerenuk is distinguishable by its long, slender neck and limbs. 
	    		These animals are about 80-100 inches tall and weighs between 68-115 lbs. 
	    		Gerenuks have two different types of coloring on their smooth coat: either 
	    		a reddish brown or lighter flanks that are fawn to buff. The horns on 
	    		Gerenuks are only present in the males and they are lyre-shaped. Only 
	    		females have a dark patch on the crown. The Gerenuk is a 
	    		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)#Brachydont" 
	    		target="_blank">Brachydont</a>, which means it has low-crowned teeth.</p>
	    		
	    	<h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
	    		<p>There is an estimated 95,000 Gerenuks remaining in the world. Right now 
	    		they are found amongst 4 countries. The main predators of Gerenuks are:
	    		humans, wild dogs, cheetahs, leopards, lions, and jackals. The problems
	    		this species face is that as Human populations expand and grow, they build 
	    		new settlements and roads that result in a loss of habitats for the Gerenuks 
	    		and other animals. This effects them in making it more difficult to find 
	    		food and shelter, and find mates. Gerenuks also have a hard time hiding from 
	    		predators when their habitats are destroyed. The African WildLife Foundation
	    		is working with governments to find solutions to help conserve this animal. 
	    		The foundation also has a luxury lodge on 5,000 acres of land in Kenya that 
	    		is protected so the Gerenuks and other wildlife can roam safely, the revenue 
	    		they gain from tourists is reinvested into this conservation act.</p>

	    	<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
	    		<p>The Gerenuk gets food from trees and the tender leaves branches that are high. 
	    		Its small nuzzle and long neck requires a need for the animal to stand on its 
	    		hind legs in order to get food from the high tree branches. The Gerenuk also 
	    		feeds on shrubs, creepers and vines but primarily eats from the high tree branches. 
	    		The Gerenuk also has small scent glands underneath the eyes.</p>
